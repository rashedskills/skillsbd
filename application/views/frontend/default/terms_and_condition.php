            <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
            <p>You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and enroll in a course or to submit a course for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us the login credential information for that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.</p>

            <p>If you share your account login credential with someone else, you are responsible for what happens with your account and Skillsbd will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team at <a class="text-primary" href="mailto:support@skillsbd.com">support@skillsbd.com</a>. We may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.</p>

            <p>Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Skillsbd and use the Services. If you are younger than the required age, you may not set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you enroll in courses that are appropriate for you. If we discover that you have created an account and you are younger than the required age for consent to use online services (for example, 13 in the BD), we will terminate your account. As an Instructor on our platform, under our Instructor Agreement, you may be requested to verify your identity <i>(Identity verification details page link)</i> before you are authorized to submit a course for publication on Skillsbd.</p>

            <p>You can terminate your account at any time by contacting Support at <a class="text-primary" href="mailto:support@skillsbd.com">support@skillsbd.com</a>. Check our Privacy Policy to see what happens when you terminate your account.</p>

            <h2>2. Course Types</h2>
            <p>Skillsbd gives opportunities to individual instructors who want to offer their own created course/s through the Skillsbd website, the Skillsbd mobile application and other related services. Skillsbd also gives opportunity to any third party institution who wants to offer their own course/s and/or workshop that they might or might not host on their own through the Skillsbd website, the Skillsbd mobile application and other related services. These two different entities offer two distinct forms of learning opportunities for the students namely; Online and Offline learning.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="row mb-3">
        <div class="col">
            <h2>3. Course Enrollment and Lifetime Access</h2>
            <p>Under our <strong>Instructor Agreement</strong>, when instructors publish a course on Skillsbd, they grant Skillsbd a license to offer a license to the course to students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course. As a student, when you enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting from Skillsbd a license to view the course via the Skillsbd platform, and Skillsbd is the licensor of record. Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the course in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).</p>
            <p>In legal, more complete terms, Skillsbd grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non- commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with a particular courses or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any course unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a Skillsbd authorized representative.</p>
            <p>We generally give a one (1) year access license to our students when they enroll in a course. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if the course topic in question is subject to change due to obsolescence, or becoming invalid at that specific time period, or if we determine its content violates our <strong>Trust & Safety Guidelines</strong>. The one (1) year access is not applicable to add-on features and services associated with a course, for example an instructor may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A services in association with a course. To be clear, the one (1) year access is to the course content but not to the instructor.</p>
            <p>Instructors may not grant licenses to their courses to students directly and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.</p>

            <strong>4.1 Payments</strong>
            <p>You agree to pay the fees for courses that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as bKash, Rocket or any other mobile banking) for those fees. Skillsbd works with third party payment processing partners to offer you the most convenient payment methods and to keep your payment information secure. Check out our Privacy Policy for more details.</p>
            <p>When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the course you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (30) days of notification from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any course for which we have not received adequate payments.</p>
            <strong>4.2 Refunds</strong>
            <p><i>Refund policy only applicable for online courses and skillsbd arranged offline courses.</i></p>
            <p>If the course you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 30 days of your purchase of the course, that Skillsbd refund your account. We reserve the right to apply a refund, at our discretion. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed.</p>
            <p>To request a refund, appy from user profile dropdown menu refund option. As detailed in the <strong>Instructor Agreement</strong>, instructors agree that students have the right to receive these refunds</p>
            <p>At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, we reserve the right to ban your account and to restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable your access to a course due to your violation of these Terms, you will not be eligible to receive any refund.</p>

            <p>If we are put on notice that your course or content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behavior violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines, or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from our platform. Skillsbd complies with copyright laws. Check out our Intellectual Property Policy for more details.</p>

            <h2>7. Using Skillsbd at Your Own Risk</h2>
            <p>Skillsbd enables anyone anywhere to create and share educational courses. We host a variety of courses on different topics on our online learning marketplace. Our platform model means we do not review or edit the courses for legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality of course content. We do not exercise any editorial control over the courses that are available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy or truthfulness of the courses. If you enroll in a course, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk.</p>
            <p>By using our platform, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Skillsbd has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or enrollment in any course, to the extent permissible under applicable law. This also applies to any courses relating to health, wellness and physical exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of courses, and by enrolling in such courses, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your enrollment in a course.</p>
            <p>When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal information that you share. We do not control what students and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety.</p>
            <p>We do not hire or employ instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between instructors and students. We are not liable for disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students.</p>
            <p>When you use our platform, you will find links to other websites that we don’t own or control. We are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites, including their collection of information about you. You should also read their terms and conditions and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>9. Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h2>
            <p>These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms that protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal relationship between us and you.</p>
            <strong>9.1 Binding Agreement</strong>
            <p>You agree that by registering, accessing or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with Skillsbd. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not register, access, or otherwise use any of our Services.</p>
            <p>If you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.</p>
            <p>If you are an individual representing a course offering Institution you are accepting these Terms and using our Services on behalf of that course offering Institution you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.</p>
            <p>Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.</p>
            <p>These Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor, the Instructor Agreement, if you are an course offering institution, the Institute Agreement and the Pricing and Promotions Policy).</p>
            <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.</p>
            <p>Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in one case, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the future. If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights generally or in the future.</p>
            <p>The following sections shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: Sections 2 (Course Enrollment and Access Period), 5 (Skillsbd’s Rights to Content You Post), 6 (Using Skillsbd at Your Own Risk), 7 (Skillsbd’s Rights), 8 (Miscellaneous Legal Terms), and 9 (Dispute Resolution).</p>
            <strong>9.2 Disclaimers</strong>
            <p>It may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or because something goes down with the site. It may happen that one of our instructors is making misleading statements in their course. It may also happen that we encounter security issues. These are just examples. You accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of these types of cases where things don’t work out right. In legal, more complete language, the Services and their content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or accuracy of the Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions (express or implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no warranty that you will obtain specific results from use of the Services. Your use of the Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdiction doesn't allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
            <p>We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will Skillsbd or its affiliates, suppliers, partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability of such features.</p>
            <p>We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused by events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.</p>
            <strong>9.3 Limitation of Liability</strong>
            <p>There are risks inherent in using our Services, for example, if you enroll in a health and wellness course like yoga, and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you agree that you will have no recourse to seek damages against even if you suffer loss or damage from using our platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we (and our platform, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of damages in advance. Some jurisdiction doesn't allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
            <strong>9.4 Indemnification</strong>
            <p>If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal recourse against you. You agree to indemnify, defend (if we so request), and hold harmless Skillsbd, our platform, and their officers, directors, suppliers, partners, and agents from an against any third-party claims, demands, losses, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from (a) the content you post or submit, (b) your use of the Services (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your violation of any rights of a third party. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Services.</p>
            <strong>9.5 Governing Law</strong>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the People's Republic of Bangladesh without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>
            <strong>9.6 Legal Actions and Notices</strong>
            <p>No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by either party more than six (06) months after the cause of action has accrued.</p>
            <strong>9.7 Relationship Between Us</strong>

            <strong>3.1 Trust & Safety Policies</strong>
            <p>You agree to abide by Skillsbd's Trust & Safety policies, Restricted Topics policy, and other course quality standards or policies prescribed by Skillsbd from time to time. You should check these policies periodically to ensure that you comply with any updates to them.

            <p>We reserve the right to remove courses, suspend payouts, and/or ban instructors for any reason at any time, without prior notice, including in cases where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an instructor or course does not comply with our policies or legal terms (including the Terms of Use);
</li>
                <li>a course falls below our quality standards or has a negative impact on the student experience;</li>
                <li>an instructor engages in behavior that might reflect unfavorably on Skillsbd or bring Skillsbd into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule;

            <strong>3.2 Relationship to Other Users</strong>
            <p>Instructors don't have a direct contractual relationship with students, so the only information you'll receive about students is what is provided to you through the Services.

You will indemnify Skillsbd against any claims arising from your use of students' personal data.</p>
            <strong>3.3 Anti-Piracy Efforts</strong>
            <p>We take piracy as a serious offense and are committed to work against those who pirate copyright and intellectual properties. But for a motivated pirate, any content that appears on a computer screen is vulnerable to theft. This is unavoidable even for today, and a problem across the industry. Companies like Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, etc. all have the same issue, and as an industry, we continue to work on new solutions to limit piracy.</p>
