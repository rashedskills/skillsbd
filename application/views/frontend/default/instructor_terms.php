            <h2>3. Trust & Safety</h2>
            <strong>3.1 Trust & Safety Policies</strong>
            <p>You agree to abide by Skillsbd's Trust & Safety policies, Restricted Topics policy, and other course quality standards or policies prescribed by Skillsbd from time to time. You should check these policies periodically to ensure that you comply with any updates to them. You understand that your use of the Services is subject to Skillsbd's approval, which we may grant or deny at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to remove courses, suspend payouts, and/or ban instructors for any reason at any time, without prior notice, including in cases where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an instructor or course does not comply with our policies or legal terms (including the Terms of Use);
</li>
                <li>a course falls below our quality standards or has a negative impact on the student experience;</li>
                <li>an instructor engages in behavior that might reflect unfavorably on Skillsbd or bring Skillsbd into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule;
</li>
                <li>an instructor engages the services of a marketer or other business partner who violates Skillsbd's policies; or
</li>
                <li>as determined by Skillsbd in its sole discretion.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>3.2 Relationship to Other Users</strong>
            <p>Instructors don't have a direct contractual relationship with students, so the only information you'll receive about students is what is provided to you through the Services. You agree that you will not use the data you receive for any purpose other than providing your services to those students on the Skillsbd platform, and that you won't solicit additional personal data or store students' personal data outside the Skillsbd platform. You will indemnify Skillsbd against any claims arising from your use of students' personal data.</p>
            <strong>3.3 Anti-Piracy Efforts</strong>
            <p>We take piracy as a serious offense and are committed to work against those who pirate copyright and intellectual properties. But for a motivated pirate, any content that appears on a computer screen is vulnerable to theft. This is unavoidable even for today, and a problem across the industry. Companies like Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, etc. all have the same issue, and as an industry, we continue to work on new solutions to limit piracy.</p>
            <p>As an instructor if you find any course materials that have been pirated from skillsbd.com please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@skillsbd.com" class="text-primary">privacy@skillsbd.com</a> with detail.</p>

            <h2>4. Price Setting</h2>
            <p>When creating a course, you are advised to select the best price for your course. You may choose any price for your course. Skillsbd being an open platform for instructors who want to create and publish their courses on the platform, promote and practice fair competition. For this reason, while reviewing your course, we might suggest a more appropriate price in cases where your selected course price might severely undercut other instructors similar courses. We do this only to keep off our platform of any unhealthy practices that might impact our students and instructors.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you may choose to offer your course for free.</p>
