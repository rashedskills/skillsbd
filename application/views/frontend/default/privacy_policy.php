            <h2>2. How We Get Data About You</h2>
            <p>We use tools like cookies, web beacons, analytics services, and advertising providers to gather the data listed above. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.</p>
            <strong>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</strong>

These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and recognizing you when you return. </p>
            <strong>Skillsbd uses the following types of cookies:</strong>
            <ul>

These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different or less functional.</p>
            <p>Some of the third-party partners who provide certain features on our site may also use Local Storage Objects (also known as flash cookies or LSOs) to collect and store data.</p>
            <strong>2.2 Analytics</strong>
            <p>We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services like Google Analytics, Hotjar, and Intercom on the Services. These services use Data Collection Tools to help us analyze your use of the Services, including information like the third-party website you arrive from, how often you visit, events within the Services, usage and performance data, and where the mobile application was downloaded from. We use this data to improve the Services, to better understand how the Services perform on different devices, and provide information that may be of interest to you.</p>

The ads may be based on things we know about you, like your Usage Data and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services, and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
            <p>Depending on the types of advertising services we use, they may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, phone, or other device to collect data about your use of our Services, and may access those tracking technologies in order to serve these tailored advertisements to you.</p>
            <p>When using mobile applications you may also receive tailored in-app advertisements. Apple iOS, Android OS, and Microsoft Windows each provide their own instructions on how to control in-app tailored advertising. For other devices and operating systems, you should review your privacy settings or contact your platform operator.</p>

            <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
            <p>This Cookie Policy was last updated on January 23, 2020</p>
            <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
            <p>Cookies are small text files stored by your browser as you browse the internet. They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites, including on Skillsbd. Cookies also allow us to remember things about your visits to Skillsbd, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use.</p>
            <p>We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time. We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Skillsbd. We use persistent cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period, like when you request that we keep you signed in.</p>
            <strong>Why does Skillsbd use cookies and similar technologies?</strong>
            <p>We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use these cookies both when you visit our site and services through a browser and through our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.</p>
            <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
            <strong><i>Authentication and security</i></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To log you into Skillsbd</li>
                <li>To protect your security</li>
                <li>To help detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Skillsbd’s agreements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, cookies help authenticate your access to Skillsbd and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts.</p>
            <strong><i>Preferences</i></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To remember data about your browser and your preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <strong><i>Analytics and research</i></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To help us improve and understand how people use Skillsbd</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of Skillsbd to see which features or content users prefer, and cookies help us see how you interact with Skillsbd, like the links you click on.</p>
            <p>We also work with analytics partners, like Google Analytics, who use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from which you arrive. Those service providers may either collect that data themselves or we may disclose it to them.</p>
            <p>You can opt out of some of these services through tools like the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" class="text-primary">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
            <strong><i>Personalized content</i></strong>
            <p>To customize Skillsbd with more relevant content</p>
            <p>For example, cookies help us show a personalized list of recommended courses on the homepage.</p>
            <strong><i>Advertising</i></strong>
            <p>To provide you with more relevant advertising</p>
            <p>To learn more about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html" class="text-primary">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>, or if you’re located in the European Union, visit the <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" class="text-primary">Your Online Choices site</a>.</p>
            <p>Please note that where advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising on other websites and applications, but it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
            <p>When using mobile applications you may also receive tailored in-app advertisements. Apple iOS, Android OS, and Microsoft Windows each provide its own instructions on how to control in-app tailored advertising. For other devices and operating systems, you should review your privacy settings or contact your platform operator.</p>
            <strong>What are my privacy options?</strong>
            <p>You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline cookies by consulting your browser’s support articles. If you decide to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some interactive features in the Services.</li>
                <li>Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, so your browser’s cookie-management tools may not remove them.

            </ul>
            <strong>Updates & Contact Info</strong>
            <p>From time to time, we may update this Cookie Policy. If we do, we’ll notify you via a notification posted on the platform. We’ll also post the updated policy on our site with a new effective date. If we make any material changes, we’ll take reasonable steps to notify you in advance of the planned change.</p>
